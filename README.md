# Automatic plant watering system

## General Soil Moisture Levels
- **Dry (10-30%)** – Suitable for drought-tolerant plants (e.g., succulents, cacti).
- **Moderate (30-50%)** – Ideal for most houseplants and vegetables.
- **Moist (50-70%)** – Preferred by tropical plants, ferns, and flowering plants.
- **Wet (70-90%)** – Needed for water-loving plants like rice, water lilies, and marsh plants.

## Optimal Soil Moisture by Plant Type

| **Plant Type**        | **Ideal Soil Moisture (%)** | **Notes** |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **Succulents & Cacti** | 10-30% | Allow soil to dry completely between watering. |
| **Orchids**          | 20-40% | Prefer well-drained, airy soil. |
| **Lavender**         | 20-40% | Requires dry to moderately moist soil. |
| **Aloe Vera**        | 20-40% | Water deeply but infrequently. |
| **Tomatoes**         | 40-60% | Keep evenly moist to prevent cracking. |
| **Roses**           | 40-60% | Well-draining soil; avoid waterlogging. |
| **Peppers**         | 40-60% | Moist but not soggy soil. |
| **Strawberries**     | 40-70% | Require consistent moisture for fruiting. |
| **Ferns**           | 50-70% | Like humid, moist soil. |
| **Hydrangeas**       | 50-70% | More moisture keeps blooms vibrant. |
| **Peace Lily**       | 50-80% | Likes consistently moist soil. |
| **Rice**            | 70-90% | Thrives in standing water. |
